How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    If the last version worked, and now it doesn't work, it will be because some change I made. So I will find the bug in the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Because you safe time looking for the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   With automatic saves, you will have a lot of versions. With manual saves, you save only when you want and need it, it will be faster

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

when you write code, it is better to save multiple files in one commit, beacause one change affects several files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I use git log to see the ID of all the commits, and git diff to compare a commit with another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

If I change something and then it doesn't work, then I could make it up without fear.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Control my versions of my code!!
